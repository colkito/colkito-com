# About me

Born under the sunny skies of Salta, Argentina, I now call the beautiful beaches of Brazil my home. Life's quite the adventure, isn't it?

## My Journey 🚀

As a kid, I was always ~breaking~ tinkering with gadgets. While my friends were out playing soccer, I was in my room, surrounded by circuit boards and coding manuals like ASM for PICs, and PHP. A cool hobby, right? 😎

These days, I'm all about pushing the boundaries of tech. Think of me as a digital explorer, venturing into the frontiers of:

- Web technologies (my first love ❤️)
- Blockchain (because who doesn't love a good puzzle?)
- AI (teaching machines to dream... what could go wrong?)
- IoT (making doors smart since 2004)
- Robotics (still working on that helpful robot)

## What Makes Me Tick ⚡️

I'm a firm believer in the power of open-source. Why keep the good stuff to yourself when you can share it with the world?

Privacy and freedom online? I'm IN. I encrypt my emails, my chats, and probably my shopping lists too. Can't be too careful, right?

## When I'm Not Coding... 🎨🌿

You'll find me lost in some art expo, enjoying a music concert or some cultural show.

Or maybe I'm out in nature, trying to teach trees about blockchain. They're not great listeners, but they're always branching out.

## My Mission 🧩

"Decentralize all the thinks!" It's not just a typo, it's a way of life. I'm here to shake things up in that way, one line of code at a time.

So, if you're into tech that makes a difference, art that speaks to your soul, or just want to chat about why centralized systems are so last century, drop me a line!

Let's make the digital world a bit more colorful, shall we? 🌈
